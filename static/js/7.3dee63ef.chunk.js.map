If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will\r\n                                    appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p className=\"PP-Subtext\">Location and Procedure.</p>\r\n                                <p className=\"PP-text\">\r\n                                    Unless you and Uber otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.

The Arbitrator may award\r\n                                    declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
